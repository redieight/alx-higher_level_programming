0. Squared simple mandatory

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
Returns a new matrix:
Same size as matrix
Each value should be the square of the value of the input
Initial matrix should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You are allow to use regular loops, map, etc.

1. Search and replace mandatory

Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
list is the initial list
search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element
You are not allowed to import any module

2. Unique addition mandatory

Write a function that makes the addition of all unique integers in a list.

Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
You are not allowed to import any module

3. Present in both mandatory

Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
You are not allowed to import any module

4. Only differents mandatory

Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):
You are not allowed to import any module

5. Number of keys mandatory

Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Prototype: def number_keys(my_dict):
You are not allowed to import any module

6. Print sorted dictionary mandatory

Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(my_dict):
You can assume that all keys are string
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (don't sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type
You are not allowed to import any module

7. Update dictionary mandatory

Write a function that replace or add key/value in a dictionary.

Prototype: def update_dictionary(my_dict, key, value):
key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
If a key doesn't exist in the dictionary, it will be created
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

Prototype: def simple_delete(my_dict, key=""):
key argument will be always a string
If a key doesn't exist, the dictionary won't change
You are not allowed to import any module

9. Multiply by 2 mandatory

Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2

Prototype: def multiply_by_2(my_dict):
You can assume that all values are only integers
Returns a new dictionary
You are not allowed to import any module

10. Best score mandatory

Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

Prototype: def best_score(my_dict):
You can assume that all values are only integers
If no score found, return None
You are not allowed to import any module

11. Multiply by using map mandatory

Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

Prototype: def mutiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0):
Returns a new list:
Same length as my_list
Each value should be multiplied by number
Initial list should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You have to use map
Your file should be max 3 lines
